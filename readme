Instructions

1. Set up Python 3.x, Jupyter Notebook and run the code `pip install -r requirements.txt` to make sure you have all the required dependencies.

2. Open logic_simulator.ipynb and access the code, relevant markdown documentation and see its working for the 2X1 MUX netlist example which is given at /circuit.txt

3. If needed change the /circuit.txt in such a way as following the following netlist convention (can also be found in first markdown box of logic_simulator.ipynb)

Netlist Convention

We shall use `.txt` netlist file (SPICE like style), to enter the graph configuration

An example input code for this circuit

inp n1 n2 n4 n6
outp n3 n5 n7

a n1 n2 n3
o n3 n4 n5
i n6 n7


inp nodes : denotes input nodes to circuit seperated by spaces

outp nodes  : denotes output nodes to circuit seperated by spaces

a n1 n2 n3  : denotes and gate with inputs n1 and n2, output as n3

o n3 n4 n5  : denotes or gate with inputs n3 and n4, output as n5 

i n6 n7  : denotes inverter with input n6 and output n7
